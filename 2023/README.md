[day_12_part_2.cpp](day_12_part_2.cpp)|Memorize everything including things resulted in zero or one arrangement.
[day_17.cpp](day_17.cpp)|Dijkstra's algorithm. Find least value at the same location, in the same direction and the same straight line length.
[day_18_part_2.cpp](day_18_part_2.cpp)|Shoelace formula `(x1 * y2 - x2 * y1) / 2` for vertex (0,0),(x1,y1),(x2,y2) and sum for interior `i`. Pick's theorem `i + b / 2 - 1` with number of input (loop of trench) for `b`, but for some reason it's `i + b / 2 + 1`.
